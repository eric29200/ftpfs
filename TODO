- ctrl-c on file cat a > b kernel oops
- cp doesn't work
- with 2 connections, "cp a b" use same connection for a and b

- when vi is opened more than 10 seconds, it complains because file has changed
  this is because of time update (local modification time in generic_write_iter != FTP time)
  seems difficult = post a message on knb

- vi opens 2 files in edition mode (for example a and a~ : so 2 connections are used = one user and one main connection)
